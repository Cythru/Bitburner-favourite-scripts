MODES (FinalStonkinton.js):
  run FinalStonkinton.js              Normal mode - same logic as original
  run FinalStonkinton.js --turtle     TURTLE UP - conservative, high-confidence only
  run FinalStonkinton.js --yolo       GO BIG OR GO HOME - 10% bets, 24min cooldown on loss

SIMPLE VERSION (FinalStonkintonSIMPLE.js):

                                  Graduates winning strategies to /strats/proven.txt

CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL:
  [+] ANSI color output - green/red P/L, colored forecasts and mode indicators

  [+] Net worth sparkline graph - visual trend over time

  [+] Reserve cash - always keeps $1m on hand
  [+] 80% max deployment - never invests more than 80% of total worth
